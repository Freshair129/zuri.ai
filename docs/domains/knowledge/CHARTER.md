# Domain charter — knowledge

Canonical business knowledge (GKS): what the system knows as governed fact —
product identity, business rules, approved answers. Distinct by authority, not
by storage: it answers "what does the system know", never "what happened"
(that is MSP, in the agent domain) and never "what is the state now" (that is
operational data in its owning domain). Architecture spec §16–19.

## Boundaries

- **Owns no business-truth Prisma models.** Its store is the production runtime's
  `zuri_core.business_knowledge` behind the knowledge port
  (`postgres-business-knowledge`), plus the governed import built by
  `scripts/build_business_knowledge_import.py`.
- The `PipelineRun`, `PipelineStep`, `PipelineEventReceipt`,
  `PipelineRecordEvent`, `PipelineReconciliation` and `PipelineGateDecision`
  ledger is owned by the integration platform. Knowledge owns the validation,
  approval and promotion boundary that consumes pipeline evidence; it does not
  own the execution ledger.
- Knowledge enters through governed import/approval — never automatically from
  conversation (spec §19: MSP → candidate → validation → GKS, in that order).
- Serves grounded answers to the agent domain through the knowledge contract;
  it does not talk to LINE and it does not resolve identity.

## Public contract

- The business-knowledge query port consumed by `grounded-business-answer`.
- The import contract (`business-contract`) with its public-field deny rules —
  prices and internal fields never cross into servable knowledge unapproved.
